Background-Feeder
=================

Loads images from a RSS feed and sets them as your active desktop background on OSX.

Currently setup to load from Reddit image Porn rss feeds, has a pulldown for the feeds of interest. 

This is an alpha v0, works for me and that is it. I am using this to experiment with various new OSX api's.
